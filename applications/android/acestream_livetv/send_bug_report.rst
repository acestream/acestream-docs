==================
Sending bug report
==================

If you think that you have found a bug in the application please send us a bug
report helping us to fix the issue.

Steps to send a report:

* Reproduce the problem right before sending the report
* Open application settings
* Select "Report a problem" menu
* Select category which describes your problem the best (select "Other" if you don't know)
* Describe your problem in the "description" field
* Click "Send" button

You should see a message "Report has been sent" within a minute which means that
the report was accepted by our servers. If you don't see this message please try
again later.

.. note:: We examine only the reports with a meaningful description.

Sometimes it's not convenient to write the problem description from your mobile device.

In such a case, you can send a report with just your email in the "description"
field and then write an email with the problem description and send it to acestream.player@gmail.com
(stating that you have recently sent a bug report).
